    <h1>Bootstraps' Bootstraps</h1>
    <p> This is me monkeying around with bootstrap. Let me type ad nauseam, so that I can see the difference
        between fixed-width containers and fluid containers. I may have to type for awhile, so bear with me. 
        Normally, I'd have long ago given over to some author's words, like, "When you are old and grey and 
        full of sleep and nodding by the fire take down this book and slowly read and dream of the sad look
        your eyes had once and of their canyons deep." Deep indeed.

        <h2>Lower School</h2>
        <p>Nurturing students in grades K - 3, our Lower School is dedicated to the whole child.
                We believe that even the youngest among us can be fine global citizens, so we begin by building awareness
                of others in the classroom.</p>
            </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4" style="background-color:rgb(201, 221, 22);"><h2>Middle School</h2>
        <p>Spanning grades 4 - 7, the Middle School strives to harness all of the energy and drive
                our young students have into speaking out for themselves and others. We cultivate advocates, helping our
                students weigh their needs, understand their audience, and propose hoped-for outcomes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4" style="background-color:green;"><h2>Upper School</h2>
        <p>In grades 8 - 12, students learn more and more to be independent, in their activism,
                in their scholarship, and in their own development. Choice is key, as we offer independent studies and 
                electives, encouraging each student to build her dream curriculum--one that challenges her heart and
                her mind.
