        <p>At the heart of the humanities is humanity, and in this class, we want to make sure that you and all of your classmates can access course 
            material and feel safe learning exciting, new skills. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p><img src="accessibility.png" align="right" alt="Accessibility picture">We have built this site with a wide range of learners in mind, making our code friendly to different web browsers, different screen sizes, 
            and different types of computers. We have also made the site easy to read for students with a range of visual needs providing high-contrast 
            colors, lots of white space, and fairly large text. If you have a need that is not met by our site, please let the instructor know so that 
            we can adjust our code to be better for you.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Safety</h3>
        <p>We believe that in order to learn well, students must take risks and sometimes fail. So, in class, particularly when providing feedback 
            on one another's work, we ask everyone to be respectful of that learning process. When things come easily to you, please offer to help 
            others who are struggling. When things come hard to you, please ask for help. The discussion boards are intended to allow you to help 
            others grow with your insights and observations, so please use them to provide only constructive comments. Anyone who does not use the 
            discussion board in a respectful way will no longer have access to it and may be dropped from this course.
        </p>
        <b>Happy learning!</b>
