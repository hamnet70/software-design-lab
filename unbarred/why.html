    <p>More than two million people in prisons, jails and detention centers in the United States do not have access to the internet or to the rapidly 
    changing technologies that increasingly dominate the social and professional landscapes of the world outside. This digital divide constitutes yet 
    another punitive effect of incarceration, because when men and women reenter communities and need to compete in a job market that privileges digital 
    skills, they find themselves at a disadvantage. What office job can a person get when they have not used a computer for years? What jobs can a person 
    without digital skills get? And if they choose to go to college upon reentry, how many digital skills will they need to master so as to succeed? 
    The failure of the prison system to address the question of digital literacy cuts formerly incarcerated people off from qualifying for a wide array 
    of jobs. We therefore decided to design a course which would teach incarcerated people digital skills. The challenge is exciting; doing digital 
    work under prison-specific constraints is appealing because it pushes against restrictions largely justified on the grounds of security concerns 
    and lack of funds, but which, we are convinced, can be got around when the benefits of acquiring digital skills so far outweigh the inconvenience 
    of building the infrastructure needed for teaching these.</p>

    <p>We started to imagine a course which would teach students to code, program and design. We did not want to design a vocational course that will 
    teach students only the skills big corporations demand, for this would be too much like turning them into cogs in a machine. We determined that 
    students would learn transferable marketable skills at the same time that they learned ways to be critical of the skills they learned. They could 
    have agency, and learn, us, what they choose.</p>

    <p>Digital Humanities is an interdisciplinary field, with room for everyone. It is radical because it is fundamentally collaborative, destabilizing 
    traditional academic and professional hierarchies and modes of thought. It extends its scope to areas beyond the academy, including the business 
    world. Practitioners in the field of digital humanities are aware that their work can be exclusive of people without expensive computers and 
    broadband, and for the field to be as revolutionary as it wants to be, it needs to include the voices of people from all backgrounds.</p>

    <p>Digital humanists create maps and websites and archives and apps and games and projects usually not for commercial gain but in pursuit of 
    knowledge and for the common good. They take historical records and look at them again in another way and come up with very different narratives 
    from the ones that were taught in school. The following words of Miriam Posner, Assistant Professor of Digital Humanities at University of 
    California Los Angeles, conjure up some of the potential of DH:</p>

    The great value of teaching DH to undergrads, I have come to believe, is...showing them how provisional, relative, and profoundly ideological is 
    the world being constructed all around us with data. It is an opportunity to show them that our most apparently universal categories&mdash;man/woman, 
    black/white&mdash;are not inevitable, but the result of very specific power arrangements. Data visualizations, maps, and spreadsheets look terrifyingly 
    authoritative to a nineteen-year-old&mdash;and to us, too. One great value of rigorous critical inquiry is that you can help people see how this was all 
    constructed, and to what ideological ends (Miriam Posner, "What's Next: The Radical, Unrealized Potential of Digital Humanities," DH Debates 
    2016: http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/54).</blockquote>

    <p>The readings we have selected for this course explore digital humanities theories and methods of inquiry. The tutorials will teach you how to 
    use digital tools to build projects of your own. The selected digital humanities projects in the resources section of this site are examples 
    of work we admire so that you can see some things other people have done.</p>

    <p>First and foremost, this course seeks to embrace human dignity as a normative value, as the Vera Institute of Justice so eloquently describes 
    one of its educational goals (see its Reimagining Prison Report included in the Readings section of this site). This pilot course is a first 
    experimental attempt to do digital humanities work in prison. As participants in this course we invite you to suggest improvements and changes 
    in course design as we go along, for this course belongs to you.</p>
