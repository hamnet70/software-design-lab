<h3>DHUM 101 Introduction to Digital Humanities</h3>
<p>City University of New York John Jay College of Criminal Justice 
<br>Reentry Institute Prison to College Pipeline and CUNY Graduate Center at Otisville 
Correctional Facility</p>
<br>

<h3>Course Information</h3>

<p>Class: Tue Thur 9:30am &mdash; 11:30am&mdash;Room B28<br>
Tutoring: Mon Wed 9:30am &mdash; 11:30am</p>

<p>Instructors: TBA<br>
Tutors: TBA</p>

<p>This course aims to introduce students to digital humanities tools and methods through readings, discussions, hands-on workshops and 
collaborative projects. Students will explore a range of ways to critically evaluate and incorporate digital technologies into academic research 
and learn to build simple websites, apps, maps, games, and data visualizations. Students will code in HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, Jekyll and other 
programming languages. This hands-on approach aims to empower students by allowing them to "own" the computers they use through becoming familiar 
with the computers' back ends, and at the same time gain technical skills that will help them get jobs.</p>  

<p>We will do computing work under a set of significant constraints of hardware, software and network capacity common to U.S. jails, prisons and 
detention centers. We are mindful that these constraints also exist in many places around the globe and we believe that the work we do in prison 
will be useful for other communities with similar constraints. We therefore approach computing with the wish to care for the environment, further 
social justice and balance gains and costs.</p>

<h5>Reading and Discussion (Weekly)</h5>
<p> Students should complete all weekly readings in advance of the class meeting and should take an active part in class discussions</p>

</p> Students are responsible for writing five blog posts on our shared course blog, two short responses to our weekly readings or in-class 
discussions and one post about a tutorial session they have attended, with the goal of helping other students understand what they learned and/or 
what they found valuable about the tutorial session</p>

<ul class="reg">
    <li class="reg">three posts about praxis assignments</li>
    <li class="reg">three posts giving feedback to other students' posts about their praxis assignments</li>
    <li class="reg">one post about the project proposal</li>
    <li class="reg">one post about the final project</li>
</ul>

<p>Tutoring sessions: students are responsible for attending a 30-minute tutoring session once a week. You are free to go to as many tutoring 
sessions as you like pending space limitations.</p>
