<!--Congratulations! You are now looking at the code behind this web site. Good coders often leave comments to help both themselves and
users understand the purpose of blocks of code. We've provided more comments than usual on this page, so you could really get a sense of
what nearly every line means. Notice the tags (the < and ! and -- bfore the text and the -- and > after it. Those keys turn the text in
between them into hidden comments that don't get displayed on the web page.-->

<!--The line below simply lets the web browser know that this is an html document.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--Every web page begins with the <html> tag and ends with the </html> tag to let the browser know where the page begins and ends.-->
<html>


<!--HTML pages have "heads" and "bodies." Nothing in the "head" section is displayed on the page, but the information in the head tags
does have an effect on how the page looks. For example, in this "head" section, which starts with the tag <head> and ends with the closing
tag </head>, there information on the title of the page (which appears in the browser tab) and the stylesheet that guides the look of the page.-->
<head>

    <!--This title appears in the browser, usually on the browser tab. It does not display in the actual page.-->
    <title>Peek at the Code</title>

    <!--This tag connects this page to a stylesheet we created that includes how the headers should look, what the text size is, and how
    buttons should appear.-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">

    <style>
        p {
            margin: 5%;
        }
    </style>

</head>

<!--Everything between the <body> and </body> tags is displayed on the page.-->
<body>

<!--The class "header" is defined in our stylesheet. Div simply stands for division. So, we have a division of the page here that holds 
a header that is filled with a color gradient--that peach color that fades into white. The class "tight" is defined in our stylesheet too, and it 
just makes the space between lines of text smaller than usual. The <h1></h1> and <h2></h2> refer to "heading 1" and "heading 2." There are six 
pre-defined heading sizes. Can you guess the tag for "heading 6"?

We use heading tags to distinguish titles, subtitles, and section headings because screen readers used by people with vision impairment, reads them as important elements of the
page.-->
<div class="header">
    <div class="tight">
        <h1>Peek at the Code</h1>
    </div>
</div>


<!--The class "row" is defined in our stylesheet, and here, we have further indicated that the contents of this row should be centered. 
    The "row" class sets up a horizontal division of text with a white background.The class "button" is defined in the stylesheet as well, 
    specifying the buttons' background and text colors as well as how much space (padding) is around the text and how much space (margin) is
    around the outside of the button. Note that we have added here that the width of the button should be about a fifth of the page.-->

<div class="row" style="text-align:center">
    <a href="index.html" class="button" style="width:20%; margin:20px">Home</a>
    <a href="why.html" class="button" style="width:20%; margin:20px">Why DH?</a>
    <a href="library-people.html" class="button" style="width:20%; margin:20px">My Library</a>
    <a href="connect.html" class="button" style="width:20%; margin:20px">Connect</a>
</div>

<!--You are probably noticing that coders indent a lot. In HTML, that's mostly for them to be able to read the code more easily. But, in
programs you'll use later, such as Python and SQL, indenting is a key to helping the processor understand commands. So, might as well get
used to it!-->
<div class="row">

    <!--What do you think the p tags stand for? Take a look at the page again and this code to see if you can figure it out.-->
    <!--While the English alphabet and most punctuation marks are recognized by web browsers, a few characters are not. Can you find a piece of
    punctuation in this paragraph that we couldn't just type out?-->
    <p>One of the first things you'll learn to do is build a webpage in HTML&mdash;the basic code behind the internet. On any webpage, including
        this one, you can look at the instructions the web developer has written to make the page look the way it does. No matter what web browser
        you are using, there is a way to see the code. Your instructor can help show you how for the computer you are on now. But, usually, the code can be
        found by right-clicking on a mouse or two-finger clicking on a trackpad and choosing the equivalent of "View Page Source." Sometimes the option 
        is available from a View menu or Tools menu at the top of the page.
    </p>

    <p>As you'll learn in one of your first lessons, HTML uses tags around text to indicate how something should look. For example, if you want
        to make some words <b>bold</b>, you put a tag with a b (for bold) before them and one with a /b after them to indicate when the bold should
        start or stop. It would look like this: 
        <!--Note the weird letters here and compare it to the page as it is displayed. Can you figure out what &lt; and &gt; stand for? The reason
        we cannot just type bold tags here is because the web brower will do its job and display the words "bold words" in bold!-->
        
            &lt;b&gt;bold words&lt;/b&gt; but it would display like this <b>bold words</b>. See?
    </p>

    <p>Web developers often provide comments to explain a chunk of their code. We've left lots of comments for you to see what the code behind
        this page looks like. Before you take a peek, try to imagine what's on this page right now that you'll expect to see. 
    </p>

<!--The class "footer" is define in the stylesheet as a small, gradient-filled rectangle that spans the page.-->
<div class="footer">
</div>

<!--The </body> and </html> are always the last two tags of the page. Without them, the page won't load, because the browser will think that
there is more to display-->

</body>
</html>
