# Kelly's Project Proposal

## Description
Development team needed to create a simple web app to track the estimated water intake of Alzheimer’s patients as their myriad caregivers, family and professionals, attend to them. 

## Requirements
The program must:
- Be super simple—this app should not slow a caregiver down 
- Be accessible by anyone with web access
- Allow input of a patient number, date, and an estimated number of ounces consumed
- Store that data for retrieval

It would be great if the program also:
- Distinguishes between water and other drinkable liquids, such as juice, coffee, or tea
- Alerts a chosen caregiver when, by bedtime, total liquids are below a set amount or water intake is zero
- Allows the alert level to be changed as a result of other factors such as gender and weight
- Confirms data before accepting it
- Links to a simple page of information on the signs of dehydration and the complications that result from it

## About Us
We at Forget-Me-Not are committed to making the lives of Alzheimer’s patients better. Through exhaustive study, we have learned that one of the most debilitating and, ironically, easy-to-fix conditions besetting the AD community is dehydration. While most caregivers, whether at home or at a nursing facility, are careful to document medical treatment, few track water intake. Furthermore, the more sophisticated the care, the wider the range of contact a patient has, making fluid intake all the harder to track and keep consistent. We believe that tracking fluids and alerting caregivers when intake is low could radically alter everyday wellbeing, increase cognition, reduce the frequency of dehydration-related complications (such as disorientation, UTIs, and even kidney failure), and, ultimately, slow the course of the disease. We also believe that providing a digital means of tracking fluid intake will raise for caregivers the priority level of assuring consistent access to this basic, yet often neglected, component of health.
