# Kelly's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I reminded myself that I'm likely to forget what we learn in class if I don't practice it every day. So, I took a few minutes every morning when I first logged on to review the command line, navigating around my computer.

Hour 1: I spread this hour over the course of the week, reviewing the basic command line commands of pwd, cd (with specific directory names, / , and ~), ls, and the handy tab and up arrow shortcuts every day, just so they became habit.

Hours 2 and 3: Learned new command line commands using the "Learn Python the Hard Way" appendix. Mkdir (including directory names with spaces and nested directories), rmdir, cd with the relative up (../), cp, mv, less, cat. All made tons of sense. Tried pushd and popd. I need practice with it. I get it intellectually, but not deeply, as I get the other commands so far. Same with recursive commands.

Hours 4 and 5: Played around with Git, using the resource Patrick gave us (so, Virtual Studio Code and checking to see that I had Git still from the DH Field Kit). Did a little markup in Virtual Studio Code. Tried the challenges and made up some of my own.

Hours 6: Reviewed everything to see what I could do from memory and what needed extra practice. Getting faster, which feels good. Still ignoring pushd and popd. Often forgetting to push files to my Github repository.

Hour 7ish: Getting to Carnegie Hall: practice, practice, practice


## Week Three (2/7 to 2/12)

Overall:



<font color="pink">Hour 1+</font>: As was the case last week, I spread this hour over the course of the week, reviewing the basic and new command line commands, VS Code, and the git commit and push processes. Even played around with some HTML in markdown (see red text below).

Hour 2: Installed Anaconda and began the Python tutorial on the syllabus to the first three exercises. Wonderered if I should heed the author's constant plea not to use Python 3, which came with the Anaconda download. As I played, I was reminded of how much proofreading goes into programming. AND, the difference between an expression to be solved (5 + 2) and one to be evaluated as true or false (5 > 2) is significant, as is every single keystroke.

Hours 3, 4, and 5: Played around the with program in exercise 3 to satisfy my curiosity. Did exercise 4 and 5 on creating variables to hold strings, numbers, and expressions. Errors were mostly typos. Had fun with exercise 6 learning how to use the %r, %d, and %s. Did exercise 7, which generated a question below. I came up with a work-around, but one of my goals is to write lean code, so I'd love to know how to concatenate print lines as simply as the author did (with a ,). The free tutorial ends at exercise 8.







<font color="#FF0134">**Questions for Patrick**</font>
- It seems necessary to install the code command every time VS Code is open or a new Terminal session is open. Is that true? Do you just leave both open all the time?
- While html tags seem to work in VS Code, they don't seem to work when uploaded to git hub. Thoughts?
- The tutorial makes a big-ass deal out of *not* using Python 3, which came with my Anaconda download. So, should I uninstall and install Python 2 instead? (I've noticed that Python 3 assumes floating point numbers.)
- What do you call using %d or %s in a string? (I'd just like to know how to talk about what I know how to do.)
- In exercise 7, the author used a comma after a print command to concatenate two print lines. It doesn't work in Python 3 (and I tried it inside and out of the parens). Thoughts?
