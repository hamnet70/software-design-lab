# Kelly's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I reminded myself that I'm likely to forget what we learn in class if I don't practice it every day. So, I took a few minutes every morning when I first logged on to review the command line, navigating around my computer.

Hour 1: I spread this hour over the course of the week, reviewing the basic command line commands of pwd, cd (with specific directory names, / , and ~), ls, and the handy tab and up arrow shortcuts every day, just so they became habit.

Hours 2 and 3: Learned new command line commands using the "Learn Python the Hard Way" appendix. Mkdir (including directory names with spaces and nested directories), rmdir, cd with the relative up (../), cp, mv, less, cat. All made tons of sense. Tried pushd and popd. I need practice with it. I get it intellectually, but not deeply, as I get the other commands so far. Same with recursive commands.

Hours 4 and 5: Played around with Git, using the resource Patrick gave us (so, Virtual Studio Code and checking to see that I had Git still from the DH Field Kit). Did a little markup in Virtual Studio Code. Tried the challenges and made up some of my own.

Hours 6: Reviewed everything to see what I could do from memory and what needed extra practice. Getting faster, which feels good. Still ignoring pushd and popd. Often forgetting to push files to my Github repository.

Hour 7ish: Getting to Carnegie Hall: practice, practice, practice


## Week Three (2/7 to 2/12)

Overall:



<font color="pink">Hour 1+</font>: As was the case last week, I spread this hour over the course of the week, reviewing the basic and new command line commands, VS Code, and the git commit and push processes. Even played around with some HTML in markdown (see pale yellow text below).


<font color="yellow">**Questions for Patrick**</font>: It seems necessary to install the code command every time VS Code is open or a new Terminal session is open. Is that true? Do you just leave both open all the time?
