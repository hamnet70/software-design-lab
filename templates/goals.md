# Kelly's Course Goals

## Goal One

**To adopt habits that promote lean efficiency in my coding and software use. From file naming and organization to streamlined, effective lines of code, I'd like to rely less on patchwork trial and error and more on purposeful minimalism.**

-----

Benchmark:
I will have reached that goal when I can point to a set of varied projects or programs that demonstrate consistency across and within their design--a consistency is visible both to me and to classmates. (I'll also know if I'm on the wrong track if I find myself hunting for files or lines of code.)



## Goal Two
**To understand (rather than MacGyver) CSS in order to better control complex Twine layouts.** 

-----
Benchmark:
The small benchmark will be if I can control how my Twine project displays on different form factors. The big benchmark (though I may not reach it until the fall) will be to use Twine confidently with my students, knowing I can make their layout visions work.



## Goal Three
**To identify an opportunity to use Python in real life and, if skills allow, to build it.** 

-----

Benchmark:
At the course's end (or as we round out our work with Python), I should be able to articulate or create a Python program that does something useful. 

## Goal Four (Bonus Goal)

**To become an accessibility critic. As I've tried to assist my aging mother with technology, I see how little is built with physical limitations in mind. I'm eager to think even more broadly about the choices designers and programmers can make to assure greater cultural, cognitive, and physical access.**

-----

Benchmark:
I'll know I've reached this goal if I can identify narrowly accessible technology that we use at Chapin and can propose to the tech director changes to our current program.
